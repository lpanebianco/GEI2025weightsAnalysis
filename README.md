# GEI2025weightsAnalysis
A computational approach to reverse-engineering the Gender Equality Index 2025 domain weights through combinatorial analysis. The notebook systematically explores all possible 5-row combinations from the dataset, solves constrained linear systems, and identifies optimal high-precision weights that best reconstruct the published index values.
